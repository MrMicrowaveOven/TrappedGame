## Implementation

The general gameplay mechanism can be found in index.html.  grid.js is the Grid on the left side of the game, and it contains Tiles (found at tile.js).  The Well (well.js) is the area on the right side of the screen where Boxes (box.js) fall.

FlashCards (flashcards.js) are the different "Decks" that are pulled from to make the values in the game (for example, the Greek Deck contains Greek letter information).

The GameMenu (gamemenu.js) displays the different games.
